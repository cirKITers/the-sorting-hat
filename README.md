# The Sorting Hat

This is a small Dash app that aims to solve the problem of assigning topics (e.g. in context of a practical course) to students.
Considering a number of students and a fixed number seats for each available topic, the students can rate each topic on a scale from 1-5.
Depending on the rating and the number of available seats, the tool will then assign the topics accordingly and reports the overall satisfacation.
